## Rust DL

This is a commande line program built in RUST (blazingly fast) used to fast download (using multi threading) any type of file in a decent time.

## Why?

Juste because i wanted to teste RUST and to squeeze every drop of my network connection!.

# You can use the program as you like

Maybe I will add a user interface in the near future.
